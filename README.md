#EEG_preprocessing_tutorial


This is a tutorial for MNE Python written in Jupyter Notebooks. 

It imports EGI data and reformats as MNE format (mff->fif).
It goes through some important pre-processing functions (cropping, ICA, epoching, visual artefact exclusion, interpolation, average reference, baseline correction).
It shows how you can then average data by condition and uses different plotting functions to visualize condition averages.
